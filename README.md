## App Brainstorming

My 3 favorite applications
1. TikTok
   - has a great algorithm that recommends interesting videos
   - video reply to comments
3. WhatsApp
   - end to end encryption of messages
   - creation of polls in chats
5. Spotify
   - great UI
   - personalized playlists
  
**An App Idea**
An idea for an app that I would like to build is a mental health journaling app that uses NLP techniques to predict user mood and provide feedback or suggest coping strategies
